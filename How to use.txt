The items in the folder selected as the source for the scripts will need to be shortcuts to the actual Powershell scripts to successfully launch.

You will need to create a shortcut, select the original script as the shortcut destination, and from there change the target of the shortcut (in the properties area of the shortcut) to: C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -command "&  'FilePathExample.ps1'"      for this program to work properly.
